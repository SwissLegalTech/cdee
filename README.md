Contract Design and Execution Engine

Disclaimer:
Within the SwissLegalTech Hackathon 2018 a contract design and execution software has been built on basis of the Deon Digital contract specification language (community license) and a Corda 3.2 database (community license). The entire code for the back-end logic of the software and a test script is included and define the created material. Importantly, this material is sufficient to run the entire solution based on the used environments which are
similar in nature to a programming lanuage, e.g., Java Script, combined with a database, e.g., an oracle database. Deon Digitals technology provides the
unique advantage of creating software for distributed end-customer applications in an incremental and extremely fast approach enhancing customer experience.
